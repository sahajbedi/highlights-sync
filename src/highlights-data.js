            consoling neurochemical bath that mollifies painful memories
            and a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and

            For the entire time that caffeine is in your system, the
            sleepiness chemical it blocks (adenosine) nevertheless
            continues to build up. Your brain is not aware of this rising
            tide of sleep-encouraging adenosine, however, because the wall
            of caffeine you’ve created is holding it back from your
            perception. But once your liver dismantles that barricade of
            caffeine, you feel a vicious backlash: you are hit with the
            sleepiness you had experienced two or three hours ago before
            you drank that cup coffee plus all the extra adenosine that
            has accumulated in the hours in between, impatiently waiting
            for caffeine to leave. When the receptors become vacant by way
            of caffeine decomposition, adenosine rushes back in and
            smothers the receptors. When this happens, you are assaulted
            with a most forceful adenosine-trigger urge to sleep—the
            aforementioned caffeine crash.

            Within the brain, sleep enriches a diversity of functions,
            including our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical
            decisions and choices. Benevolently servicing our
            psychological health, sleep recalibrates our emotional brain
            circuits, allowing us to navigate next-day social and
            psychological challenges with cool-headed composure.

            it feels harder to acclimate to a new time zone when traveling
            eastward than when flying westward. There are two reasons for
            this. First, the eastward direction requires that you fall
            asleep earlier than you would normally, which is a tall
            biological order for the mind to simply will into action. In
            contrast, the westward direction requires you to stay up
            later, which is a consciously and pragmatically easier
            prospect.

            poses—then pull off the road into a safe layby for a short
            time. Take a brief nap (twenty to thirty minutes). When you
            wake up, do not start driving. You will be suffering from
            sleep inertia—the carryover effects of sleep into wakefulness.
            Wait for another twenty to thirty minutes, perhaps after
            having a cup of coffee if you really must, and only then start
            driving again. This, however, will only get you so far down
            the road before you need another such recharge, and the
            returns are diminishing.
